# Introduction

Neolife accepts payments through various channels from her distributors and customers. This includes but not limited to online payments, direct bank deposits, transfers and USSD payments. Neolife does not accept any form of cash payments which makes us rely heavily of integrations with payment providers via an API.

# Project Structure

This is an ASP.NET MVC Project that uses a Model-View-Controller approach<br>
This project has some key components that make up the entire project. <br> There are lots of components but Iâ€™ll focus on the key three components and all the classes<br> in each of them and what to do when integrating a new provider either for online payments or sending payment notifications to us.
